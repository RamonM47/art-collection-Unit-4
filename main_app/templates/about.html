    <h1>Purpose:</h1>
    <p>
      I originally made this application to keep track of any and all progress on my drawings/paintings. Keeping track of individual pictures on separate platforms made it hard for me to learn much from a drawings previous iterations, and having them on hand helps me see the growth and where to eventually take any piece that I am working on. I figured that other artists who can benifit from this should have the ability to use it, so anyone who signs up will have this useful tool on hand too.
